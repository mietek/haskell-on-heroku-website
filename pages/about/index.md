About
=====

_Haskell on Heroku_ is a system for deploying [Haskell](http://haskell.org/) web applications to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) rapidly and reliably.

To get started with _Haskell on Heroku_, see the [examples](.), and continue with the [user’s guide](guide/).

Interested in deploying other Haskell applications?  Try [Halcyon](http://halcyon.sh/).


### Internals

For an in-depth discussion of _Haskell on Heroku_ internals, see the [programmer’s reference](reference/).

_Haskell on Heroku_ is built with [Halcyon](http://halcyon.sh/), a system for deploying Haskell applications, and [_bashmenot_](http://bashmenot.mietek.io/), a library of functions for safer shell scripting in [GNU _bash_](http://gnu.org/software/bash/).

Additional information is available in the [Halcyon user’s guide](http://halcyon.sh/guide/), the [Halcyon programmers’s reference](http://halcyon.sh/reference/), and the [_bashmenot_ programmer’s reference](http://bashmenot.mietek.io/reference/).
